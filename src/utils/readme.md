# In asyncHandler.js , why anonymous function and why we need to return anonymous function
Here why anonymous function

`In JavaScript, when you want to define middleware in Express.js, you need to define functions that accept three arguments: req, res, and next. The additional anonymous function here serves that purpose. It acts as the middleware function that is executed when the wrapped requestHandler is called.`

Here's why the anonymous function is returned:

`In JavaScript, when you define a higher-order function like `asyncHandler`, it's often used to create and return a new function. This returned function can capture variables from the outer scope (in this case, `requestHandler`) and customize its behavior before execution. `


1. **Encapsulation**: By returning an anonymous function, you encapsulate the logic inside `asyncHandler`, ensuring that variables like `requestHandler` are preserved and accessible only within the scope of the returned function. This helps in maintaining a clean and modular code structure.

2. **Flexibility**: Returning a function allows for flexibility in how it's used. The returned function can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function, or directly used as middleware in an Express.js application.

3. **Closure**: Returning an anonymous function forms a closure over the variables defined in the outer scope (`requestHandler`). This means that even after `asyncHandler` finishes execution, the returned function retains access to `requestHandler` and any other variables it might need.

4. **Execution Control**: By returning a function, you gain control over when and how the encapsulated logic (`Promise.resolve().catch()`) is executed. The returned function serves as a wrapper around this logic, allowing you to decide when to trigger it (i.e., when a request comes in).

In summary, returning an anonymous function from `asyncHandler` allows for encapsulation, flexibility, closure, and control over the execution of the encapsulated logic, making the code more robust and adaptable.`
